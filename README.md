# Batman CRUD System

## Overview

The Batman CRUD System is a project developed using Python and Tkinter. This application allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations while providing a simple and clear interface for managing data. This project marks my first time learning and implementing MySQL and was created after completing a course on Tkinter. For the user interface, I utilized Tkinter Designer from this repository: [Tkinter Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer).

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.
- **Show**: Display all records in a user-friendly format.
- **Clear**: Clear input fields for a fresh start.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for development.
- **Tkinter**: The GUI toolkit for creating the user interface.
- **MySQL**: The database management system used for storing data.
- **Figma**: Used for designing the user interface.
